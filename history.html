        <h1>History of the Olympic Games</h1>
        <p>The Olympic Games have a rich and storied history that dates back to ancient Greece, with the first recorded games taking place in Olympia in 776 BC. These early games were held in honor of Zeus, and they were a part of a religious festival that attracted athletes from all over the Greek world to compete in various events such as foot races, wrestling, and chariot racing.</p>
        
        <h2>The Ancient Olympic Games</h2>
        <p>The ancient Olympic Games were held every four years for nearly 12 centuries until they were abolished in 393 AD by Emperor Theodosius I, who sought to suppress pagan festivals. During this period, the Olympics were considered one of the most prestigious events in the Greek world, with athletes striving for glory and honor. Victors were celebrated as heroes, and they often received rewards like olive wreaths, statues, and privileges in their city-states.</p>
        
        <h2>The Revival of the Modern Olympics</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Games were revived in the late 19th century, thanks to the vision of French educator Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Inspired by the ideals of ancient Greece and the desire to promote international peace and unity through sport, Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, marking the beginning of a new era.</p>
        
        <h2>Growth and Globalization</h2>
        <p>Since their revival, the Olympic Games have grown to become the largest and most prestigious international sporting event, bringing together athletes from over 200 countries. The Olympics have also evolved to include the Winter Games, Paralympics, and Youth Olympics, offering a wide range of sports and events. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the Olympics have become a platform for promoting cultural exchange, unity, and sportsmanship on a global scale.</p>
    
        <h2>Notable Moments in Olympic History</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Games have been the stage for many unforgettable moments, from Jesse Owens' four gold medals in Berlin 1936 to the unifying impact of the "Miracle on Ice" in 1980. Each edition of the games tells a story of triumph, perseverance, and the human spirit, making the Olympics a cherished tradition that continues to inspire generations.</p>
